Dark Theme Single Image Carousel Gallery
This project is a web-based image gallery featuring a dark theme, displaying one image at a time in a carousel layout. Users can navigate through images using "Previous" and "Next" buttons, with smooth scrolling transitions. The buttons include hover animations (scale and glow effects), and the gallery is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. The code is organized into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for maintainability.

Features

Navigation: "Previous" and "Next" buttons allow cycling through images, disabling at the first/last image.



Dark Theme: Sleek dark aesthetic with dark gray backgrounds and vibrant blue buttons.



Hover Animations: Buttons scale up and glow on hover (when not disabled).



Smooth Scrolling: Images slide in smoothly using the CSS scroll-behavior property.



Responsive Design: Adapts to various screen sizes, maintaining one image in view.



Separated Files: Code is split into index.html, styles.css, and script.js for clarity.
